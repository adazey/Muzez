# Muzez
Muzez is a free music downloading program that pulls from both SoundCloud and YouTube.
The program is still in developmet, and is nowhere near completion.

### Requirements
  + Python 2.7
  + ffmpeg (Linux only)
  + libmp3lame

### Installing:
#### Linux
I haven't tested this with anything other than Ubuntu, and I don't know how other distributions install packages. If you have experience with any other Distro and are able to install it, if you could email me the installation code, that'd be awesome.
```
sudo apt-get install python2.7 pip ffmpeg libmp3lame0
```
#### OSX
I'll update this in a few days when I can use a friend's Macbook to install this. If one of you could email me the install instructions before I do, that'd be awesome.
```
I don't know yet.
```
#### Windows
This is going to be the most complicated as the package is currently. I'm going to have a seperate Windows section when I can build an EXE of the program. If one of you could build the EXE and email me the files, that's be awesome.
